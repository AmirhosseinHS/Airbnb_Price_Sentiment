# Using Sentiments of Online Consumer Reviews to Improve Price Prediction on Airbnb

In this course project (MATH80629), my teammate and I have built several price predictions models for the listings in Airbnb and we have also represented a comparison between different models’ performances. The input we have used for our models is Toronto Airbnb data from Inside Airbnb, that provides open source and non-commercial data about Airbnb listings usage in many cities all around the world. The dataset contains numerical and text data about the available listings, and we have extracted more than 20 features that are the most important and representative of our prediction task. To create the price prediction models, we have developed linear regression, ridge and Lasso regression, support vector regression (SVR), random forest regression, XGBoost model and a neural network model. Furthermore, we study how sentiment analysis of guests’ reviews improves the prediction compared to when review score rating is used in the prediction models. At the final step, we explore the effects of combining two different datasets to see if it improves the model results when it is tested on a completely new city in comparison with a model which is trained on a single dataset.
